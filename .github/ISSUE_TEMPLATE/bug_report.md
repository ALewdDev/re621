### Expected behaviour
Tell us what should happen.

### Actual behaviour
Tell us what happens instead. Check your JavaScript console for errors and provide them if applicable.

### I'm seeing this behaviour on
Browser + Userscript Manager e.g. Tampermonkey on Google Chrome v80.

### Steps to reproduce
If you have a consistent method to create the error describe your steps here.

### Exported settings
Attach you exported settings here if you want. This is not required but will help us track down issues depending on your settings.
